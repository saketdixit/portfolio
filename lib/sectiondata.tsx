            I graduated with a degree in{" "}
            <span className="font-medium">Computer Engineering</span>, and landed my first job at a startup creating
            solutions for the retail space, working as a{" "}
            <span className="font-medium">Software Developer</span>.{" "}
            After working hard for 2 years, I decided
            to upskill myself with a Masters' degree in Computer Science. Being interested in research, I worked at a research firm called
            Fact Finders Pro to build a solution to detect misinformation online, leveraging {" "}<span className="font-medium">Machine Learning models as well as LLMs.</span> 
            My next gig was at a firm building smart Fire-alarm monitoring systems. I worked there for a bit, but ultimately decided that {" "}<span className="font-medium">embedded systems
            and microcontrollers</span> was not my jam. Thereafter, I moved to India, and am currently looking for a {" "}
            <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> in FullStack Development.
            My preferred stack is{" "}
            <span className="font-medium">
            React, FastAPI, Python, and MySQL/MongoDB
            </span>
            . I am also familiar with TypeScript, Javascript and C#. I am always looking to
            learn new technologies to add to my skillset.

            <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy reading, travelling, playing
            video games and meeting people. I also enjoy{" "}

            learning about{" "}

            learning how to play the guitar.
